You will see two different versions
of CPU Tests Vol.4 v1.0, what this means
is that the "CPU_Tests _VolumeIV_v1.0 Revised"
(below and not in a folder) is the working version
of this particular ROM. The other is in a separate 
file marked "Prototype CPU Tests Vol.4 v1.0" 
this was extracted from a Prototype ROM of this 
particular image and you will see that in a program 
that reads .bin files at the bottom there is information 
from the team who created the fourth and last ROM. 
This ROM freezes and has some bugs, hence why we don't want to 
use it. If you want to mess with it or change things you are 
welcome to, consider it a learning device or hidden easter egg.

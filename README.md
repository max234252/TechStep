# TechStep
Hardware information relating to the Apple Techstep

The schematics have some of my ramblings from the original reverse engineering process which may or may not be of any relevance to anyone else
To the best of my knowledge the schematics here are fully accurate however the clones I eventually made where produced using a modified version of this so I cannot completely grantee this
This is not based on any original documentation and was produced by me manually tracing out the board from a original unit

The MCU is a MC68HC711E9, The dump is 64K in size despite the MCU only having 12K of program space. I'm not 100% clear why my programmer creates the file like this but I have left it as is, the code is in the last 12K of the file

Scans of all the original PCB's (except the DC in board) with components removed are in the "Scans" directory

Information here is provided in the hope it my provide useful in reverse engineering the software design of the TechStep or assist in the repair of damaged original units

# Where are the schematics of the Keypad and Power boards?
I never drew proper schematics for either of these as they where not needed for producing the clones
A tracing of the Keypad PCB done in Sprint Layout 6 is in the "Keypad" directory, If I can find my original hand drawn schematic of the DC in PCB I will scan and upload this

# What about the ROM Packs?
I never even traced these out as SuperSVGA beat me to it, Gerbers of his clone ROM are available elsewhere
ROM dumps are in the ROM directory. These where not created by me, I believe these dumps are all from either SuperSVGA or Jajan547 but if I'm wrong pleas let me know and I'll update the credits appropriately 

# Clones you say?
Yes, this was originally done to produce clones :)
If you are interested in purchasing A clone you can contact me on 68kmla or TinkerDifferent (I go by the name "max1zzz on both) or they are available in the US from CayMac Vintage's store
